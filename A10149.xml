            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>¶ In the firſte buddynge tyme of Chriſt his churche, lorde, with howe many afflyctions was the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded: with howe many waues of ſundry perſecutions, knocte and bet at? with howe many tourmentes &amp; deathes tryed? Agaynſt which, the

<pb facs="tcp:4645:18"/>not auoyde; which is euery where, &amp; ſeeth euery both thought &amp; deade.</p>
            <p>ANd ye that are by Goddis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hearers, be not ſlack of your part in your vocacion &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: be obedient vnto your heades &amp; teachers, &amp; that for conſcience ſake. Paye to euerye of theim their dew with good wyll, be it tribute, honor, feare, loue or reuerence: S. Paule requireth no les at your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: and his warrant to Tymothe, touchyng your dutye, conteyneth no contrary leſſon. Ye haue the holye and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt in your handes: If you be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt in your dutye, the greater is your faute: if ye know it and folow it not, who ſhall excuſe you.</p>
            <p>It greeueth me to ſee ſuch daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deuiſion, ſo great diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as is preſently in force emongſt you: it is a vehement preſumption,
<pb facs="tcp:4645:18"/>&amp; ſure token, that ye haue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſed that comfortable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gods ſweete worde. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherof is, to make ſuch as doo acquaynt them worthely with it, les proude, leſſe vicious, leſſe diſhobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, leſſe contencious, leſſe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, leſſe couetous. But in that ye are more in all, and leſſe in none: it appeareth, ye dyd more proffytte therin, when ye had leſſe knowledge therof. Ye haue hearde, reade, and ſearched it, I denye not: but youre lyfe proueth that he haue read it as if ye read it not, your eye not ſingle: Ye heare it, as if ye hearde it not, your intent not pure: Ye ſearche it as though ye ſearched it not, your mynde vngodlye. And this is the occaſyon that ye receaue ſo ſmalle profit &amp; fruit therof: for he that ſeeth your conuerſacion, heareth of your behauors, ſercheth your dooynges,
<pb facs="tcp:4645:19"/>ſhal fynde you in all, far wyde from yor profeſſyon. And no meruell, ye ſought not for it. Many of you are mighty talkers: iolye braggers, gret queſtmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, al that ye ſought for. For as in one and the ſame field the Bee dothe enſue the floure: the gote, the ſteme or ſtalke: the ſwyne, the roote: the foure feeted beaſtes, the fruite: Euen ſo in the ſcriptures dyuers is your intent: ſome of you ſeeke matter of talke: ſome, ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge oppinions: and ſome proufes and arguments to maintayne your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes &amp; mad imaginacions be they good or badde: ſome, the knowledge onlye: ſome, the waye to liue well: and fewe ſeeke after that waye. It is the beſt parte, and the leaſt parte of you haue enſued it. And after this ſorte, readyng and ſerchyng the ſcriptures, what meruell is it if ye he gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into wronge and corrupte
<pb facs="tcp:4645:19"/>ſence: whiche ſoughte not after the pure &amp; ryght vndecitandyng therof: If ſo many ſciſmyckes and hereſies be ſprong among you, which ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, ſo vnworthely preſume to abuſe the reuerent &amp; worthy woorde of God. For as to them that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer charged with wyne, theire eyes ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes daſell whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei perſwade them ſelues to ſee manye thynges, where in deede they ſee but one.</p>
            <p>Lykewyſe ſuche as doo ſo raſhlye &amp; vnaduiſedly with vnpure mynde &amp; vngodly intent reade and ſerche the ſcriptures of God, doo forge &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen many ſtraunge ſentences there vpon, perſwadynge them ſelues to ſee many thynges therein, where in deede they ſee not one therof: ſo he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye headed be thei with pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, couetouſneſſe: ſo daſelyng ar their eyes with ſelfe loue, pertinacy &amp; diſdainfulneſſe. But good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treimen
<pb facs="tcp:4645:20"/>remembre the great care and trauell of the moſt redoured prince, or he coulde: the loue that he wolde bring it vnto your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: forget not that it is a hygher matter then the booke of Rodynhoode: Conſyder what commodytie enſueth by the righte vſe therof. Deceaue not the louyng exdecracion of ſo hygh and fatherly a Prince conceyued of you, do not fruſtrate his traueil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Prouoke not Goddis ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce vpon you, dooe not abuſe his holye worde: Spoyle not your louies from ſuche heauenly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſures and comforte, do not tourne it into our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucion. And frame your ſelues yet at lengthe worthelye to vſe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Margatete: put on a ſingle and a doues eye, which ſeeth only heauenly thynges. Let your heartes be inflamed with hote deſire
<pb facs="tcp:4645:20"/>towarde it. It doth not vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe vulgarelye to be loued, after a commen ſorte to be affected: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth a thirſty mynde, a hungrye and greedye ſtomake, but after it, a lone: And at the fyrſt entraunce in to it, ye muſt laye a parte all pride, vainglory, and diſdainfulneſſe oute of your heartes. For although the Courte of Goddis woorde be veray large and ample, loftye and hyghe: yet the doore wherein ye muſt enter, is veray lowe: and none can enter into it, but ſuch as are lowe, humble and meeke of ſpyrite. And it is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten token that ye haue good ſucceſſe in that Courte: and that ye are well in fauour with the high Lorde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if you daily proue more &amp; more mylde, meeke, ſobre, humble, and lowlye of heart.</p>
            <p>Suche only dothe he reteygne in fauour: to ſuche only he vouchſafe
<pb facs="tcp:4645:21"/>to talke in that his holy worde, and diſcloſe his high &amp; ſecrete miſteries: whiche are ſhutte vp vnto the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaunt &amp; proude. It reioyſeth the ploughmans hert to behold the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of his grayne or corne rather to hange downewarde then to ſtande bolte vp right: becauſe he knoweth perfectly them to be lode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe void of good fruyte</p>
            <p>The high plowghman Chriſt, coueyteth to ſee the ſame in you: to whom ye ſhall be an acceptable and fruytfull herueſt, if your heades be not cocked vp with vayn glory, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, and pride, but bowed downe with all humilitie and meekeneſſe.</p>
            <p>If it proue not ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you, thynke not that ye haue any whyt proffeted in his worde. For as Menedemus was accuſtomed to ſaye that manye ſayled to the ſcole of Athens, which at beginnyng ſeemed to them ſelfes

            <p>
               <hi>FINALLY</hi> if anye remayne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs quycke as yet &amp; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne we ſtyll: Be we not diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for any thing wee ſee. There are many hereſies, no wondre: there haue ben more. Many are infected with them, why not: therfore they are permitted, to tempte &amp; proue the wytte of man. Let not all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue vs from our ſtanding: but for aſmoche the weakeneſſe of man gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth might to hereſies (they of them ſelfes beyng of no force and myght) and the deuyll there cometh onlye &amp; preueyleth, where faythe is feble to withſtande and reſyſt: ſee we ſtande ſure: ſee our houſe be euermore well

It is no wondre (as I haue ſayde) that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſyes are: it is a greater occaſyon of wonder if we be found ſo ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided and ſo yll appointed, as not to be able to repell and keepe of ſo weake an enemy. For if we arme our ſelfes with vnwaueryng faythe in Ieſus Chriſt, no dout we ſhall be ſtronge &amp; of power ſufficient to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our aduerſarye the deuyll his intent: who daily laboureth by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry pollicies to diſcharge that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable weapon from vs, to thende he mought enter our holdes.

And

And this was Arrius o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: of whom in my booke I do treate more at large: and as many as do holde that opinion, are called of Auncient wryters, Arrians: and therfore I intitle my treactiſe: The fall of the late Arrian: not diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge hys name throughe oute my worke, but vnder the name of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian: whom I wold be loche to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, if he hath Recanted that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemous oppinion, as ſome ſaye that he hathe. This oure late Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian therfore not long ſynce was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerten of the Counſell &amp; dyuers other Learned men, for his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by whoſe procurement I know not.
<pb facs="tcp:4645:29"/>And deliuered the ſame his opinion with his prouffes in writyng to the lord Archbiſhop of Cau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng therunto at length required, as in the begynnyng of his writyng he confeſſeth. Wherof dyuers copies came into diuers mens ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: And one was ſent to me, from a frende of myne: who required me to peruſe the ſame, and to let him dnderſtand what I thought of it. To whome I dyd eftſones reſtore it incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, writyng vnderneth the ſame for my anſwere to my frendis demaunde, nothing els but <hi>Vae hoi per que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> venit ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Then being of mynd neuer to haue ſayde one worde more vnto it, Yet I thought it veray ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and expedient, that ſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous &amp; perilous opinion ſhuld be confuted by ſome man, and that with ſpeedye expedicion: In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion the people nowe a dayes
<pb facs="tcp:4645:29"/>for the moſt parte, be ſo good of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, that nothyng is to harde for them to learne: eſpeciallye if they heare of any new leſſon not taught, or herd of a long tyme before: Then nothyng cometh a myſſe vnto them, nothyng to harde for them to learne and beare away, althoughe, it be in deade neuer ſo muche agaynſt God the Father, and his natural Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. But in this behalfe I was in maner careleſſe: for reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brynge what a ioylye multitude of freſh writerse there ar in theſe daies, I thought this geare coulde not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape vnlooked on, But, ſeeyng in other trifelyng matters of no effect &amp; importauunce to ſpeake of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this: they are ſo readye with their confutyng, bookes, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes, and pleyes. In ſo weyghtye a cauſe as this is, I reckened they wold not be ſeene ſlacke or neclige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb facs="tcp:4645:30"/>but out of hande, with all celeritie and ſpeede withſtande it. How be it reckeners without their hoſte muſte recken twyſe, I haue hearde ſaye. Hytherunto, not one of them haue ſayde one worde vnto it, or by mirth, pley or erneſt game, that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare of: what they wyll, I knowe not.</p>
            <p>For my parte at begynnynge I thoughte nothynge leſſe then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte anye ſuche enterpriſe, as I haue nowe taken in hande: partely becauſe I haue not exercyſed me ſelf in the lyke before tyme, and chieflye for that I ſuſpected much my wytte and connyng: therfore I ſuppoſed beſte for me, hauynge neither exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſe ne connynge to dwell in myne olde ſilence and not to mell eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this matter, beyng of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce and hygh difficultye, far aboue my compaſſe and reache.</p>
            <p>Beſyde this, I pondered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:4645:30"/>ſent condicion of this worlde with me ſelfe, I thought in ſuche hurlye burlye, in ſo great tumultes, the voyce of ſuch one ſhuld not be herd: For if the wordes of Eccleſiaſticus are true, that the voyce of the wyſe is hearde in quietneſſe, it booted not to ſpeke in ſo vnquiet a time as this is, (I thought) and of ſuch matter. And to helpe forwarde, the ſaiynge of the Prophet came eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the nick to my remembraunce: <hi>Intelligens, in tempore illo tacebit: .i.</hi> The wiſe wyll keepe ſilene in that tyme.</p>
            <p>All this notwithſtandyng, when I coulde not perceyue or here tell, that any had taken in hande to improue and confute this moſt daungerous &amp; blaſphemous opinion: Charitie whiche ſeeketh not any priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentacion or pleaſure at any tyme, but euermore couetyng to vanquiſh the difficultie of all tymes &amp; ſeaſons
<pb facs="tcp:4645:31"/>vehementlye prouoked me to vtter ſome parte of my mynde in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: Wherunto the chyldren eke whiche were in Babylon, dyd not a lytle (as me thought) encourage &amp; hexten me forwarde, whoſe example enſtructeth vs, that we ought with free courage and good heart, chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to witneſſe the truth, although the whole worlde were agaynſte it: which euen out of the myo burnyng fyre ſange merely Pſalme to God: not regardig the multitude of them which deſpiſed the truthe: but ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed them ſelfes beyng. iii. in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre.</p>
            <p>Wherfore neither my ſmall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, nor my ſlender knowledge, ne yet the aboundaunce of Iniquytie (which kepeth reuell now a dayes) haue defaſed me: But my hope fixed in the helpe of the Holye Spirite, I haue not kycked agaynſt the ſpurre of Charitie, nor haue ſpurned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
<pb facs="tcp:4645:31"/>the zeale and oue whiche I beare towarde my Countrey, bothe a lyke togyther prickynge me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde herto: But haue moſt wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly, I wotte not how happely, ſhewed forthe the truthe touchynge this mater of Chriſtis Deuinitie.</p>
            <p>Beſechyng the Chriſten Reader, if I haue not ſatiſfyed thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in all poyntes, yet wyll good to my good wyll, and beare with my weakeneſſe: ſufficient it is and ynough to wyll well in highe maters, writers ſayen: the matter is hyghe, my wyl is good, accept thone for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſake, <hi>Valete.</hi>

For as ye haue not diſſimbled your ſentence and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ye ſaye, no more wyll Ioiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimble or couler with you herein. I tell you therfore truth lyke a frend, that your breath is ſo abhominable ſtinkyng, by reaſon of that peſtilent vapour fumyng vp from the ſynke of your blaſphemous ſtomake, that
<pb facs="tcp:4645:35"/>no Chriſtian canne abyde it. And where as ye thus depraue the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tofore remembred and theire lyke, the cauſe not alleaged, whiche moued you to reporte them ſo: it is cleare that it was, becauſe hyther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ye haue not learned to ſay wel of any body, &amp; not for their deſertes. Howbeit the circumſtaunce of your wordes may let vs tunderſand the cauſe: verly for that they teache, defend &amp; iuſtifye Chriſt is deuinitie, and you wyll none of that.</p>
               <p>It were much more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, with your penne to confute by good learnyng, if they be ſuche as ye ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge them, rather then thus ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly vpon no manifeſt occaſion that ye alleage to diffame &amp; bacbite them.

Is this the fruit of the right fayth, of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ye promiſed to folow? Hath the holy ſcripturs taught you to conclude thus, to whiche ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to leane and cleaue, withoute wreſtyng and detortyng the ſame to wrong ſenſe? Haue ye tryed oute of the ſacred founten, the ſtreme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye promyſed ſo faythfully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, without troublyng and pudling the ſame, or that there wer more Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſtes then one, that ye come in with your: <hi>Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he which was. &amp;c.</hi> Or that Ieſus Chriſt borne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was not God?

               <p>To anſwere you ſhortly. I deny the argument: And ſay that Chriſt is God: notwithwandynge he was here amongeſt vs, viſible, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. &amp;c. Yet is he no viſible God. Neuertheleſſe, true God is he, was, and ſhalbe euerlaſtingly, inuiſible, incomprehenſyble, and immortall. To him that is fleſhly and carnal in his vnderſtandyng, veray harde it is to conceaue how this may ſtand. Our ſenſes can not comprehend the truthe in this matter. Wee muſte therfore cleaue to fayth only for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all herein, which eaſely amounteth vs vp into this tower of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge. We muſt ſuſpende reaſon, for it worketh treaſon to all Godds Miſteries: it reaſoneth not worth a fygg in all ſuch poyntes. We ought therfore I ſay, in fayth and ſpirite, to learne the knowledge of Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:4645:50"/>Chriſt, not by reaſon &amp; wyt, Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe we ſhall be deceaued, &amp; proue our ſelfes at length to be very arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doltes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we thinke vs to be moſt ſure, and beleue vs to be moſt wyſe. Wherfore natural iudgement &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon ſerte a parte: let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcolers to fayth, vntyl we haue well learned this leſſon. And fayth wyll teache plainly what euery true Chriſtian is bounde to thynke and beleue herein: She wyll teache vs to beleue ſtedfaſtly, that Ieſus Chriſt is true God, not made, but whiche was from the begynnyng equall to God the Father: agayne, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was true man, borne of Mary, ſtyll Virgin: &amp; that he dyed on the Croſſe to redeme mankynde, beyng loſt through the fal of Adam: and that he ryſed a gayne the thyrde daye, accordynge to his promeſſe, Conqueror of death and ſynne: and
<pb facs="tcp:4645:50"/>that he now ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father, a continuall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor for all that beleue in him.</p>
               <p>Fayth wyl teache vs alſo that there be .iii. diſtincte and ſeueral perſons: the Father, the Sonne, the Holye Ghoſt: yet no .iii. Godddes, but one God all .iii. and all .iii. one God, This is one parte of Faythes doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, to hyge for our carnall ſenſes to reach vnto. And the it ſoundeth muche agaynſt our reaſon to thinke it true: yet it maketh all with oure ſaluation, to beleue it moſt true,</p>
               <p>And albeit right nowe good ſyr, ye promyſed to folow right fayth, and the true vnderſtandyng of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: yet canne ye not brooke thys geare: but earneſtlye contende that there is no ſuche thynge becauſe your eye, and other your corrupte ſenſes tell you that he was here in a viſible forme, and that he dyed. &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:4645:51"/>whiche is not to be founde in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature ye ſay: and I graunte forſothe that God is inuiſible, and immortall, and that in no wyſe the Godhead canne be ſeene, or dye. I graunte lykewyſe that Chriſte was here ſeene in the worlde, lyke a man, and that he dyed: yet fayth byddeth me to ſaye and a byde by, that Ieſus Chriſt is God, notwithſtandynge that viſibilitie and that mortalitie. If ye aſke me by what rule I proue this: very by the rule that neuer ſquareth, not of mans inuencions, but of the worde, wherof, the truthe it ſelfe is author Ieſus Chriſte, the true naturall and only ſonne of god the father, and in him ſelf true God and man: he and his woorde be all one: he can not lye, and hys worde can not be falſe: his worde beareth wytnes that it is ſo: and fayth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requyreth me to beleue it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>This argument is not good, the reaſon not true: notwithſtandyng, the maior is vndoutely trew, and can not be falſe: For tho Chriſt was ſeene, &amp; was crucified to death, yet it foloweth not therfore, that Chriſt was not God: for he was both God and man.

Ye wold hereby emproue Chryſt his de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinitye but it wyll not frame with you. To contende that Chryſt hath not the deuine nature in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe the ſame nature is ſingle, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to no creature and ſo forthe. <hi>Non ſani eſſe hominis non ſanus iuret oreſtes: .i.</hi> A mad man might ſwere that it were no wiſe mans part. The reaſon is bycauſe he was God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and had in hym both that ſingle nature which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munycable to no creature, which is incomprehenſible explycable with no ſpeche. &amp;c. And alſo the nature of man vnlike to the other in all the propryeties ye haue reherſed: hauing therfore both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in him, yf by the one your ſenſes might comprehende hym to be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:4645:89"/>not by that, that he had not the other in him by which he is God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible: for the ſcriptures ar manifeſt that he had both in him. As we haue tofore ſufficiently declared. And where you ſaye that the deuine nature is communicable to no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it can not be denyed. Neither can ye faſten the contrary vpon vs, becauſe we beleue Chriſt to be bothe God &amp; man: and to haue in him the natures of both. For albeit he true God toke on him true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to thend he one myght be both. And beynge bothe is but one perſon, and in the ſame but one Chriſt: yet are not the two natures made one, or in anye poynt confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded or mixt, altered or chan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged from thier firſt condicion &amp; ſtate: them not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatynge or participatynge with thother in anye conſideracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The word was made fleſh, ſayth ſ. Ihon: He meaned not
<pb facs="tcp:4645:90"/>that the word was turned into fleſh, or that the worde and the fleſh were made one in ſubſtance: but that the word was made fleſh, that is to ſay, the worde tooke vnto it the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, wholly &amp; perfectly: that where before he was but the worde, and the ſonne of God only, nowe he myght be man and the ſonne of man alſo. That phraſe of S. Iohn may be vnderſtanded y the lyke vſed of S. Paule, where he ſayth: <hi>Chriſtus pro nobis factꝰ eſt maledictus:</hi> Chriſt was notte in deede the ſame thynge <hi>Miledictum:</hi> but becauſe he tooke vpon him <hi>Maledictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> for our ſakes, therfore it is ſayde: <hi>Factus eſt male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum:</hi> Euen ſo &amp; in the lyke forme it is ſaide in Iohn: <hi>Verbum caro fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt,</hi> becauſe Chriſt beyng that worde, vouchſafed for our ſakes to put on him our nature, &amp; ſo became man: he receaued the ſhape of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
<pb facs="tcp:4645:90"/>vpon him which he had not, but he left not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhape of God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which he had: he was the word, &amp; the worde was made man. Thus the worde and man concurryng and meetyng togither, one ꝑſon is made, and in the ſame, one Chriſt, hauyng in him .ii. diſtinct &amp; dyuers natures, yet but one perſon: whiche natures tho they be vnited togyther in him and meete in perſon of his Godhed, yet are they not ſo vnited, thei do not ſo meete that they be mingled &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded togyther, as water &amp; wyne, leuen &amp; dough, thone beyng altered and confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into &amp; with thothers ſubſtaunce, But theſe Natures in Chriſte remayne togyther inconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibiliter, ſayth S. Auſten: That is inconfuſely and vnmixt, nor altered, chaunged, or immuted in anye one iote of their firſt &amp; proper ſtate, force or vertue. How may this be ye wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4645:91"/>ſay that the deuine nature &amp; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man coulde be vnited togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Chriſt &amp; to one perſon, &amp; thone not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate or perticipate with thothers ſubſtance. I can not teache you tunderſtande howe: but ye may learne by your ſelfe howe to beleue it. And therfore S. AuſTen byddeth you to aſke your ſelfe, how your ſelfe but one man can haue in your ſelfe .ii. dyuers and ſundry na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inconfuſely exiſtynge: as the ſoule &amp; the bodye. Therfore the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, &amp; the nature of man at vnited &amp; conglutinate, togyther in one Chriſt and to one perſone of the ſame Chriſtꝭ Godhead, after a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, ineffable, &amp; inexplicable wiſe, eche nature notwithſtandynge that vnion that conglutinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtil remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng in the integritie and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before that vnion or conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion it was. Of which vnion altho
<pb facs="tcp:4645:91"/>Origen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth that no ſimilitude proper &amp; fear inough ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be brought, yet he compareth the ſame too yron which is fyred and inflamed, ſaieng: As the fyre doth penetrate the yron, and of euery ſyde is mixed vnto it, ſo the worde ſayth, he receauynge hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, ſhyneth in the ſame throughout and in euery parte: And the humane nature enkendled as ye may ſay, with the lyght of the ſame, is vnited vnto the word: And as the yron is not altered into the nature of the fyre, or the fyre into the nature of yron: ſo neither is the deuine nature turned into the humane nature, nor the humane nature conuerted into the deuine nature.</p>
               <p>Thus the deuine nature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandyng this perſonall vnion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſtyl inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable, ſingle, incomprehenſible, and inexplicable: touchynge the incomprehenſibilitie
<pb facs="tcp:4645:92"/>wherof and inexplicabilitie, I haue ſayde ynough to fore.

Your argument therfore ye ſyr, is to yonge, and a great dele to weake as therwith to proue that Chryſt is not a true God, becauſe the Prophetes and other more vyle creatures are called goddes, in the ſcriptures: the name is to no effecte where the power is not: thei I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were in name gods, but not in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Ieſus Chryſt, was not onely in name, but in all power true God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to his father: as is declared. And as the name makethe not that God whereunto it is applyed. So is it veray madnes to contende and affyrme, therefore Ieſus Chryſt not to be God, bycauſe the Prophetes with other creatures be termed god in the ſcriptures, and yet not gods therby: As ye ſeeme to do. Ye ſhuld haue compared their doynges and qualities together with Chryſtes,
<pb facs="tcp:4645:100"/>and ſo declare youre rable of gods to be as muche gods, as Chryſt is, aſwell in power as in name. But ye were well aſſured that in ſo doynge ye ſhulde haue marde all the mater you go about: and therfore ye pleied a wiſe pagent, not one word ſo much to ſpeak therof to dye for. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes I graunt were termed gods and they dyd many myracles: But none ſo manye, none with the lyke vertue, none with the like authorite, as Chryſt dyd. For Chryſt neuer prayed, neuer called vpon the helpe of the father, at any tyme when he wolde do any myracles. Who had ſo al his power of his father, that he had the ſame equal with the father. <hi>Demona dii gentium:</hi> ſayth Saynt Paul. But marke what oddes is be twyxte them and Chryſt: Chryſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray God, became man, dyed for man with his deathe reconſyled man to
<pb facs="tcp:4645:100"/>God his father. What haue your gods done ſyr, or what do they that you make your compariſon betwene them and Chriſt, for ſoth thei delude the ſely pore ſoules: that they myght be companyons of darkenes with them. But Chryſt brought lyghte into the worlde, made open the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whereby he healed all.

Ye ſaye that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Chryſt is termed by theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as humble, meeke, obedient. &amp;c And agayne, worme, lyon, ſyn with other the lyke. Whiche names ye ſaye, may not be admytted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne nature: therfore ye conclude that Chryſte beyng called by theſe names can not haue in him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne nature, And how well it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, who ſo blynde that ſeethe not I haue by the ſcriptures declared at large, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chryſt was not God alone nor man alone: but bothe, God and man. And had in him ſelf not onelye the nature of man as ye wolde haue it, but the veray nature of god alſo as ye wolde not he hadde with your good wyl, And as he was true man ſo was he humble, obedyent, meeke,
<pb facs="tcp:4645:111"/>&amp; pacient: Which names haue great commendacion in man ye ſaye, and ſo let them haue in hym. To the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne nature ye wyll not haue them applied, well, I wyll not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende againſt you therin. I graunte againe that he is called by theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the ſcripture as ſheepe, ly on ſynne: &amp;c. But to affirme that he is not true god therfore, becauſe he is termyd by ſuche names, it were to groſelye and more then folye. As well ye may conclude, that he was not man. For a ſheepe, is not man: nor the lyon, man: nor the worme, man: But Chryſt in called ſheepe, lyon, and worme: ergo he is not ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: As iuſte as germans lyps.

<pb facs="tcp:4645:111"/>vnto hym in the Scritpures. The application of whiche names, aſwell prouethe the father not to be God, as the ſon. So by your alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion, we ſhal haue no God anone But acknowledge rather bothe the father and the ſonne to be God, and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with me that ſuch names are attrybuted to Chryſte, to do vs knowledge, howe that Chryſt, all yf he was true God, and thoughte it no roberye to be equall with God the father in all omnipotenſye: (As Paul wytneſethe of hym) Yet for our ſakes becam eman: and in his humanitie, dyd humble him ſelfe as man in this worlde, was obedient to his ſendynge, gentlely and pacyent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſuffered thextreme crueltye, and outragious vilany of the Iues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerctſed vppon him.

               <p>He is called <hi>Vermis</hi> a worme, in conſideracion of the humilitie which was in hym aboue other: who dyd humble hym ſelfe to all thynges for oure ſakes. Pouertye is an heuye

This argument is ſtarke naughte, and not worthe a ruſh: For Chriſt beynge bothe perfect God &amp; perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomtymes (as I haue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times ſayde) ſpeaketh as God, ſomtymes as man: as here in this place in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideracion of his manhead, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the preſent diſpenſacion of the fleſſhe whiche he receaued, he ſayth to the mother of Zebedees chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren, that it is not in him to giue for any to ſit on his right hand, &amp; on his left hand.

And as in this place, in conſideracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſay) of his preſente ſtate then, and hys humanitie, he ſayde that it was not in his power to diſpoſe the ſeates of his kyngdome: ſo mought you haue

But Ieſus Chriſte dyd all of hym ſelfe, neuer prayed, neuer inuocated the father what tyme he wolde ſhew any miracle, but of his owne deuine power, and with his onlye worde he wrought miraculons wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders: what ſayde he too Lazarus,<note place="margin">Iohn. xi.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:4645:141"/>Tabita aryſe.<note place="margin">Act. ix.</note> Lykewiſe to Eneas, which kept his bed .viii. yeares, he ſayd: Eneas, the lord Ieſus Chriſt make the whole, aryſe and make thy bead. If S. Peter coulde worke ſo hygh miracles in Chriſtes name, was not Chriſt hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe able to do the lyke, and more greater in hys owne name? Wherfore loke howe muche difference is betwene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundyng, and deſyring: geuyng &amp; deſeruyng: of him ſelfe, &amp; by anothers power: ſo much diſcrepau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is betwene Chriſt &amp; other in workyng miracles. And foraſmuche to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde, to giue of himſelfe, and by no other power, life to the dead, health to the ſycke. &amp;c. is for god only to do: Beleue Chriſt to be god, that hath and can do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame. And the other that dyd nothing but vpon deſyre, &amp; deſert through fayth and prayer, and by an other power, call them not godds, neither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare them with Ieſus Chriſt for ſhame.</p>

            <p>Which fayth except euery one do kepe holy &amp; vndefiled: without dout he ſhall peryſh euerlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>And the Catholyke fayth is this: that we worſhyp one God in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Trinitie in vnitie.</p>
            <p>Neither confoundyng the perſons: nor deuydynge the ſubſtaunce.</p>
            <p>For there is one perſon of the father another of the ſonne: and an other of the holy ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But the godheade of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy gooſt, is al one: the glorye equall, the maieſtye coeternall,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4645:143"/>
            <p>Such as the father is, ſuch is the ſonne: and ſuch is the holy ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The father vncreate, the ſonne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create: and the holy ghoſt vncreate.</p>
            <p>The father incomprehenſyble, the ſonne incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyble: and the holy ghoſt incomprehenſyble.</p>
            <p>The father eternal, the ſonne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: and the holy ghoſt eternal.</p>
            <p>And yet they are not thre eternales but one eternall.</p>
            <p>As alſo there be not thre incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſybes, nor thre vncreated: but one vncreated, one incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible.</p>
            <p>So lykewyſe, the father is almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye the ſonne almighty, and the holy ghoſt almyghtye.</p>
            <p>And yet they are not thre almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, but one almyghtie.</p>
            <p>So the father is god, the ſonne is god, and the holy ghoſt is god.</p>
            <p>So lykewyſe the father is Lorde, the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Lord, &amp; the holy goſt Lord. And yet not thre lordes but one lord
<pb facs="tcp:4645:144"/>For lyke as we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> veritie: to acknoweledge euery perſon by hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelf to be god and lorde.</p>
            <p>So are we forbydden by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke religion: to ſay there be thre goddes, or thre lordes.</p>
            <p>The father is made of none: neither created nor begotten.</p>
            <p>The ſonne is of the father alone: not made nor created, but begotten</p>
            <p>The holy goſt is of the father and of the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: neither made nor created nor begotten but procedyng.</p>
            <p>So there is one father, not thre fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers, one ſonne not thre ſonnes: one holy gooſt, not thre holy gooſtes.</p>
            <p>And in this trynytie none is afore nor after other: none is greater nor leſſe then other.</p>
            <p>But the whole thre perſonnes be coeternall together and coequall.</p>
            <p>So that in al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, as it is afore ſayde: the vnitie in trinitie, &amp; the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in vnitie, is to be worſhippyd.</p>

            <p>He therfore that wyl be ſaued: muſt thus thinke of the trinitie.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is neceſſary to euer laſſing ſaluacion: that he alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue ryghtlye in the incarnacion of our lorde Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
            <p>For the right faith is that we beleue &amp; confes: that our lord Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, is god and man.</p>
            <p>God of the ſubſtance of the father, begotten before the worldes: and man of the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his mother, borne in the worlde.</p>
            <p>Perfecte god and perfecte man: of a reaſonable ſoule, and humayne fleſhe ſubſyſtynge.</p>
